          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Yes, include your LinkedIn URL on your resume, provided your profile passes the 8-point readiness check below. A strong profile actively helps the application. A weak, stale, or contradictory profile actively hurts it. The question is not whether to include a LinkedIn URL; it is whether your LinkedIn is ready to be seen.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Recruiters will check LinkedIn whether you link it or not. If your name is on the resume, the profile is one Google away. The point of adding the URL is to make their life easier, which pushes your resume slightly up the queue, and to control which profile they land on (your primary one, not a near-duplicate from 2014).

          If you are job-searching quietly while still employed, enable LinkedIn&apos;s Open to Work flag only for recruiters (not public), and turn off activity broadcasts before updating your profile. Your current employer cannot see the Open to Work signal when set to recruiters-only, but they can see if you suddenly add 8 new skills in one evening.

        <p className="mt-3">
          For sensitive industries (defence, government, medical), confirm whether linking personal social presence on a job application violates your current employment contract. This is a small set of cases but worth checking.

            { q: 'Is it OK to put LinkedIn as a hyperlink in a PDF?', a: 'Yes, preferred. Hyperlink the text so the recruiter can click from the PDF viewer. Keep the display text as the short URL, not raw https.' },
            { q: 'What if I do not have a LinkedIn at all?', a: 'Create one, even a minimal one. Having no LinkedIn is read by recruiters as a red flag, especially for roles above entry-level. 90 minutes of setup is worth it.' },
            { q: 'Should my LinkedIn headline match my resume title exactly?', a: 'Match the role and domain; the headline can be slightly more descriptive. Example: resume says Backend Engineer; LinkedIn says Backend Engineer at Razorpay, Payments & Reconciliation.' },
            { q: 'Does the ATS care about the LinkedIn URL?', a: 'Some ATS parse it and pre-populate LinkedIn data into the candidate profile. Most do not. Either way, a recruiter will click it manually in the next step.' },
            { q: 'Is the Open to Work green ring visible to recruiters?', a: 'The full ring (the one anyone can see) is visible to all. The recruiter-only setting is only visible to paid LinkedIn Recruiter accounts. Use the recruiter-only option if you are searching confidentially.' },
            { q: 'Should I add a QR code to my LinkedIn URL?', a: 'No. QR codes on paper resumes look gimmicky; on digital resumes they are redundant. A clickable URL is enough.' },
            { q: 'Can I skip LinkedIn for design or creative roles?', a: 'You can skip the URL, but add your portfolio or Behance / Dribbble instead. Having zero online presence for a creative role reads as concerning.' },
