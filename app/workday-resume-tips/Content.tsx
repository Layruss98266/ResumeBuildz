          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Workday powers the applicant tracking system at roughly 50 percent of Fortune 500 companies, including Amazon, Walmart, Accenture, Salesforce, Netflix, Airbnb, Cisco, Bank of America, and hundreds more. If you are applying at a large employer, there is a 1 in 2 chance Workday is the first gate your resume goes through. Tuning for it specifically is worth it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Workday parses resumes more strictly than some modern ATS platforms (Greenhouse, Lever) but more leniently than legacy systems (Taleo, iCIMS). Its parsing quirks are well documented and the fixes are simple: single-column layout, exact keyword spelling, boring section headings, and clean date formats. Candidates who follow these rules see a measurably higher match score in the recruiter view.

        <p className="mb-3">When you upload a PDF or DOCX, Workday runs three steps:</p>
        <ol className="list-decimal pl-5 space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-700">
          <li><strong>Extract raw text.</strong> Reads the document top-to-bottom, left-to-right. Multi-column layouts scramble here.</li>
          <li><strong>Identify sections.</strong> Looks for headings like Experience, Education, Skills. Creative headings fall through to default categories with lower confidence.</li>
          <li><strong>Populate profile fields.</strong> Maps parsed content to structured fields (job title, employer, dates, skill list). These fields feed recruiter search.</li>
        </ol>
        <p className="mt-3">Recruiters then search the candidate database by field, e.g. Skills contains Python AND Years of experience greater than 5 AND Location is India. Your resume reaches a human only if these searches return you.</p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">Profile Sync: the hidden gotcha</h2>
        <p>
          Workday accounts sync across tenants. When you apply to Company A on Workday, your profile (resume, skills, work history) gets cached. When you then apply to Company B a week later and upload a slightly tailored resume, Company B may still see the Company A version because of tenant-level caching behaviours on the underlying Workday account.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          The fix: create a fresh Workday account (new email) per application if you are heavily tailoring. Or, use the Edit Profile flow within the Company B tenant to override. Do not assume your latest upload is what every subsequent employer sees.

            { q: 'Should I upload a PDF or DOCX to Workday?', a: 'Both parse equally well. PDF preserves formatting better for the recruiter side view. Default to PDF unless the posting explicitly says DOCX.' },
            { q: 'Do I need to fill out the web form after uploading?', a: 'Yes, for fields the parser missed or got wrong. Spend 2 minutes verifying job titles, dates, employers, and skills. Mis-parsed fields hurt your match score.' },
            { q: 'Why does Workday show my old resume even after I uploaded a new one?', a: 'Profile Sync caches across tenants. Use the Edit Profile flow on the new tenant, or create a fresh account for the new application.' },
            { q: 'Does Workday care about my cover letter?', a: 'Workday parses cover letters as a secondary document. Some recruiters read them, some do not. Always include one if the field is present; never send the same cover letter you sent elsewhere without tailoring.' },
            { q: 'How many skills should I add to my Workday profile?', a: '10 to 20 skills mapped directly to the target JD. Workday allows many more, but the first 10 are what recruiters see on the candidate card.' },
            { q: 'Can I delete my Workday profile?', a: 'Per-tenant, yes. You can request deletion from a specific company Workday tenant via their privacy page. Global deletion (across all Workday tenants) requires emailing their privacy team.' },
