This includes your resume data (personal information, experience, education, skills, etc.), your API key for AI features (if you choose to use them), and your theme preference (light/dark mode). This data never leaves your browser and is stored only on your device. You can clear this data at any time through your browser settings.",

When you use this feature, your resume data is sent directly from your browser to Groq\'s servers — it never passes through our servers. We do not have access to your API key or the data you send to Groq. Please review Groq\'s privacy policy for information about how they handle your data.',
